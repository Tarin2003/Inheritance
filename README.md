# Inheritance Using C++
This C++ program demonstrates basic inheritance in object-oriented programming. The person class holds common attributes like name and age, and it has a display() function to show this information. The student class inherits from person and adds a unique id attribute. It also overrides the display() function to show both personal details and student-specific information.

## Key Concepts
Inheritance: student inherits from person.

Constructor Initialization: The student constructor calls the person constructor using an initialization list.

Method Overriding: The student class overrides the display() method from the person class.
